Hackathon submission (17/12/2024) for tip deconvolution.

Aim: To fix tip artefacts in AFM images such as blunt tip and double tip.

Dataset: We are using the same dataset as in the "afm_imperfect_probe.ipynb" notebook. We reate a fake dataset by changing the parameters of the tip (choosing the parameters from random distributions).
